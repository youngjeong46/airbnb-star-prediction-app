    <h1>Looking to rent out a room? Planning on buying a rental property?</h1>

    <p>Say you have a property laying around... Or you are looking to buy a property and rent it out for some sweet
        cash.
        First Place you will seek is probably... Airbnb!
    </p>
    <p>But wait! If you are a SuperHost, you can make on average $1200 more per month. But how do you get there? You
        have to
        have a 5* rating and maintain it!</p>
    <p>But how do you go about doing that? How can you ensure you give yourself the best chance to do so? This is where
        we
        come in.
        I believe I have the product that can help you get started on curating your listings for the 5* ratings that you
        will crave (believe me, I know. I used to list my place on Airbnb).
