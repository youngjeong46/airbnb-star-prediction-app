# Flask App: Predicting Airbnb 5 Star Ratings


## Overview

![screenshot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/datatostories/flask-app-screenshot.png)

This is a source code for the flask app I created. The app receives user info about a listing, or a potential listing, on AirBnB, and
predicts the probability of it receiving a 5-star ratings on AirBnB. The app will also suggest one amenity addition that will give the biggest probability boost. 
You can see the application in action [here](http://airbnb-ratings-app.herokuapp.com/).

This is based on a classification project I did on predicting whether an AirBnB listing in Seattle will receive a 5-star ratings or not. The github repo for the project
is [here](https://github.com/youngjeong46/airbnb-star-prediction), and the blog post on the project can be found [here]("https://datatostories.com/posts/2019/05/11/airbnb-ratings-predictions/").
